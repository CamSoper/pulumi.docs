The Pulumi Cloud REST API is used by the Pulumi CLI to query and interact with state information, history, stack tags, etc. This API is available for end users to integrate into their own automation use cases.

## Endpoint URL

For the Managed Pulumi Cloud (i.e. [app.pulumi.com](https://app.pulumi.com/)), API endpoints are prefixed with the following url:

```
https://api.pulumi.com
```

If you are using [Self-Hosted Pulumi Cloud](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/), then use the configured endpoint for the [Pulumi API component](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/components/api#api-service) (e.g. `https://api.pulumi.example.com`).

## Authentication

All requests must be authenticated using a token via the `Authorization` HTTP header.

The `Authorization` header must be in the form below with the literal string `token`, then a space, then your access token value.

```
Authorization: token {token}
```

To view your access tokens, or create a new one, view the <a href="https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens" target="_blank">Access Tokens</a> page. You will see a list of past tokens, when they were last used, and have the ability to revoke them.

The Pulumi Cloud REST API will return a 401 status code if the token is missing or invalid.

## Required Request Headers

The following headers are required for all operations except where explicitly noted:

```
Accept: application/vnd.pulumi+8
Content-Type: application/json
```
