features:
  - header: Resource Search
    subheader: Find anything in any cloud
    body: Ask any questions about your infrastructure across more than 100 clouds, using either structured search queries or natural language prompts. Search helps you find that needle in the haystack – locating a single resource across many clouds and environments – as well as running sophisticated queries such as tracking down untagged or expensive resources across the whole organization.
