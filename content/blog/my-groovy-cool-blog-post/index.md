export class MyBucket extends pulumi.ComponentResource {
    constructor(name: string, opts?: pulumi.ComponentResourceOptions) {
        super("pkg:index:MyBucket", name, {}, opts);

        const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket(name, {
            acl: "public-read" // Public by default is fine, right?
        });
    }
