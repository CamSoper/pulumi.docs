As part of the Pulumi IDP announcement at Pulumi Up, we introduced Pulumi Private Registry. For years, we’ve worked with organizations that have built their own internal developer platforms on top of Pulumi. During that time, we identified what we believe is the best method for creating flexible golden paths—a bottom-up approach that utilizes a central source of truth to drive golden paths. Thanks to Pulumi Private Registry, this approach has never been simpler.

## Codified Security and Compliance

Platform teams use components and templates to standardize how resources and programs are shaped and provisioned. Platform teams also use components and templates to ensure security, compliance, observability, and other operational requirements are included by default. Platform teams use tools like [Pulumi ESC](/docs/esc/) and [Pulumi Policies](/docs/insights/get-started/add-policies/) directly in IaC code to ensure that any component or template available in the registry is secure from Day 1.

## Streamlined Publishing

Once a component or template is authored, publishing it to the private registry is as simple as running a single CLI command.


## Simplified Discovery

Publishing packages to the private registry is as simple as running a single CLI command. Once published, developers can discover standardi zed infrastructure building blocks compliant from Day 1. Developers get immediate context thanks to automatically generated API docs and consume READMEs.

## Free Day 2 Context

Day 2 operations comprise most of the effort when managing the infrastructure lifecycle. However, though common, maintaining, extending, and decommissioning infrastructure can feel like flying blind. With the Pulumi IDP’s bottom-up approach, driving building block publishing, discovery, and consumption through the private registry affords usage insights for free. Platform engineers can understand where components are used and at what version, simplifying the process of upgrading and decommissioning packages.
