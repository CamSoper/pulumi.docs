Pulumi founder and CEO Joe Duffy, an industry leader in cloud infrastructure, is embarking on a global tour in 2025, bringing deep insights, best practices, and lessons learned to the Pulumi community and customers. The focus is on **building scalable, secure, and developer-friendly infrastructure platforms together** while learning from real-world experiences.

## A Community-Driven Approach to Infrastructure

At Pulumi, we know that **innovation thrives on collaboration**. Our community of engineers, platform teams, and developers drive the evolution of infrastructure practices. Throughout his journey, Joe will not only share lessons learned from working with leading organizations like **BMW**, **Snowflake**, and **NVIDIA**, but also actively listen to the challenges and feedback from Pulumi users worldwide.

Together, we'll discuss key themes that matter most to the community:

- **Codifying cloud practices** to improve consistency and repeatability.
- **Empowering developers with self-service** to accelerate innovation.
- **Embedding security, compliance, and cost efficiency** into platforms.
- **Managing growing workloads and evolving demands** with agility.
- **Navigating the AI revolution**, which has dramatically increased the need for scalable infrastructure.

## Meeting the Community Where They Are

Pulumi is committed to **meeting developers, infrastructure teams, and platform teams where they are**, whether in their cloud journey or in their city. This tour is not just about sharing insights‚Äîit's about listening, understanding, and co-creating better solutions for the community.

Feedback from the community and customers directly influences Pulumi's product innovations. Every meeting, discussion, and shared experience helps refine our roadmap for building **better infrastructure platforms together**.

## A Global Exchange: Connecting Across Five Continents

Joe Duffy's World Tour spans **five continents**, bringing together **users, customers, and industry leaders** to enrich the conversation around modern infrastructure as code, platform engineering, and cloud security.

Joe will also launch the **Pulumi User Group (PUG) meetups** in **Tel Aviv**, **Chicago**, **S√£o Paulo**, and **Detroit**, meeting with developers, platform engineers, and engineering leaders to discuss shared challenges and ideas for the future.
