## What is Infrastructure as Code?

[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/) is an approach to automating the provisioning and management of infrastructure using software engineering principles, approaches, and tools. Rather than manually configuring servers, networks, and cloud resources through user interfaces or command-line tools, IaC enables you to define your entire infrastructure declaratively through code.

This approach brings the same benefits that have revolutionized software development—version control, automated testing, code reviews, and CI/CD pipelines—to infrastructure management.

## What Are Infrastructure as Code Tools?

Infrastructure as Code tools are platforms and frameworks that enable you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources through code rather than manual processes. These tools translate your infrastructure definitions into API calls that create, modify, or destroy cloud resources across various providers.

The most effective IaC tools share several key characteristics:

- **Declarative syntax**: Describe what you want, not how to achieve it
- **Multi-cloud support**: Work across different cloud providers and services
- **State management**: Track the current state of your infrastructure
- **Preview capabilities**: Show what changes will be made before applying them
- **Idempotency**: Safe to run multiple times with consistent results

## Why Use Infrastructure as Code Tools?

Modern organizations rely on IaC tools for several critical reasons:

**Consistency and Repeatability**: Deploy identical infrastructure across development, staging, and production environments, eliminating "works on my machine" problems for infrastructure.

**Speed and Efficiency**: Provision complex multi-cloud infrastructures in minutes rather than hours or days of manual work.

**Collaboration and Governance**: Enable teams to work together on infrastructure changes through code reviews, version control, and automated testing.

**Cost Management**: Automatically provision and deprovision resources as needed, preventing resource sprawl and unexpected cloud bills.

**Compliance and Security**: Enforce consistent security policies and compliance requirements across all infrastructure deployments.

**Disaster Recovery**: Quickly recreate entire infrastructures from code in case of outages or data center failures.

- AWS CDK: Outstanding official documentation with workshops and examples
- Kubernetes: Vast ecosystem but steeper learning curve

### How important is open-source licensing for IaC tools?

Very important for long-term strategy:

- Apache 2.0 (Pulumi, CDK) offers maximum flexibility
- MPL 2.0 (OpenTofu) ensures open-source availability
- BSL (Terraform) restricts commercial competitors
- Proprietary (CloudFormation, ARM) ties you to specific vendors

Choose open-source tools like Pulumi or OpenTofu to avoid vendor lock-in.

### What about security and compliance?

All major IaC tools support security best practices:

- Built-in policy engines: Pulumi CrossGuard, AWS Config, Azure Policy
- Third-party scanners: Checkov, KICS, Terrascan work with all tools
- Compliance frameworks: Most tools support SOC 2, PCI DSS, CIS benchmarks
- Secret management: Integration with Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault

Pulumi offers the most comprehensive built-in security features with CrossGuard policy as code.

### Can I migrate from one IaC tool to another?

Yes, migration tools exist:

- Pulumi offers `pulumi convert` for importing from Terraform, ARM, and CloudFormation
- Terraformer can import existing cloud resources into Terraform/OpenTofu
- CDK Migrate helps move from CloudFormation to CDK
- Manual migration is always possible by recreating resources in the new tool

Start with Pulumi for the smoothest migration experience and future flexibility.
