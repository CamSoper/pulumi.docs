## No-Code Stacks

Deploying projects from templates using the New Project Wizard and Pulumi Deployments has been a user favorite for two years and is perfect for point-and-click provisioning. Now, with No-Code Stacks, users can instantly deploy new stacks with a single click and with no code.

## Low-Code Programs

Users often need to compose their own Pulumi programs, but platform engineering teams want to ensure they are using approved components. With the new Pulumi Private registry and the latest generation of Pulumi components, thatâ€™s never been easier.

Platform engineers can author and publish components in any language they choose. Users can then discover the available components through the private registry, obtain the YAML definition (or any other language), and deploy their infrastructure.


## Full Code Programs

In some organizations, platform engineers want to offer application teams a starting point without dictating how the infrastructure is deployed. To facilitate this journey, organization templates are now available from the Pulumi CLI. Application developers can scaffold infrastructure using the same templates available from the private registry, directly from the comfort of their terminal.
