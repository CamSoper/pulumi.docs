The Pulumi Internal Developer Platform (IDP) is a bottom-up approach for platform teams to provide self-service workflows to their users, from Day 0 to Day 2. Unlike an Internal Developer Portal, the Pulumi IDP facilitates concrete outcomes, not merely information consumption.

The Pulumi IDP can facilitate workflows across the Day 0-2 spectrum thanks to powerful features like the Private Registry, Components, Templates, Services, and more. By using a bottom-up approach, platform engineers can codify security, compliance, and operational requirements in their golden paths without extra effort.

## Day 0 - Establish a central source of truth for standardized golden paths

Platform engineers and other centralized teams curate an infrastructure source of truth by authoring and publishing components and templates to the Pulumi Private Registry. The templates and components are codified with security, compliance, and operational standards to ensure golden paths are hardened from the beginning.

Learn more about the Pulumi Private Registry, Pulumi Components, and Pulumi Templates. You can also learn about securing artifacts with Pulumi ESC and ensuring compliance and standards with Pulumi Policies.

## Day 1 - Provision infrastructure through persona-driven workflows

Users discover golden paths through the private registry or the new project wizard. Depending on their use case, they may choose to scaffold several components in their preferred programming language or YAML. Alternatively, they can point and click to deploy a workload directly from the new project wizard using Pulumi Deployments. Regardless, thanks to the bottom-up approach of the Pulumi IDP, workloads are deployed via golden paths, leveraging artifacts that have been authored and approved by platform teams.

Learn more about the Pulumi Private Registry and Pulumi Deployments.

## Day 2 - Establish context and gain insights to maintain and extend infrastructure

Users can easily model their infrastructure using Pulumi services, logical groupings of Pulumi entities, such as stacks and ESC environments. Users can also adjust configuration and redeploy stacks directly from the Pulumi UI when using No-code Stacks.
