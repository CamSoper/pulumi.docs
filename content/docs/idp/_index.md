    Pulumi IDP gives platform teams the ability to build secure, compliant, and customizable golden paths for provisioning infrastructure. It uses a bottom-up approach, allowing teams to codify best practices from the start. 
    
    Built on Pulumi Components and Templates, platform teams can define building blocks once and enable developers to consume them the way that’s best for them. Developers can leverage components when writing Pulumi programs in their preferred programming language, scaffold components using low-code YAML templates, or deploy templates point-and-click from the Pulumi console.
