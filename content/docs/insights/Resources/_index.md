Pulumi Insights helps you explore, search, and analyze all the cloud infrastructure in your organization, across every stack and cloud provider.

The **Resources** page in the Pulumi Cloud console offers three main ways to explore your infrastructure:

- **Resource Explorer** – A visual interface for filtering, grouping, and navigating your cloud resources interactively.
- **Resource Search** – A powerful structured query language for advanced filtering, tagging, and property-based searches.
- **AI Assist**– Built into both experiences, allowing you to ask natural-language questions like "show me all production resources" or "list S3 buckets created last month."

Each method gives you different ways to answer questions about your cloud environment, including:

- What resources are publicly exposed?
- How many compute instances are running across all providers?
- Which resources were modified in the last 30 days?
- What stacks have resources tagged with `costcenter:1234`?

You can explore these resources directly in the UI or programmatically via the [Pulumi Cloud REST API](/docs/pulumi-cloud/cloud-rest-api/#resource-search).

To get started, choose the method that best suits your workflow:

- Use **[Resource Explorer](/docs/insights/resources/explorer/)** to click, filter, and group resources interactively.
- Use **[Resource Search](/docs/insights/resources/search/)** for fine-grained control over your queries.
- Use **[AI Assist](/docs/insights/resources/resource-search/#ai-assist)** ask natural-language questions about your infrastructure.
