## PR Reviews

When a review is requested, provide your review as a single comment on the PR, regardless of length. The user should have ONE comment that lists ALL their issues in order to keep the conversation noise to a minimum. 

When describing an issue, be specific, provide actionable feedback, and provide line numbers where applicable.

These rules **must** be followed during all pull request reviews:

- Always enforce `STYLE-GUIDE.md`. If not covered there, fall back to the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
- Check **spelling and grammar** in all files.
- Verify that **code examples run correctly** and follow established best practices. Do not suggest untested code.
- Confirm that **all links resolve** and point to the correct targets (no 404s, no mislinked paths).
- Validate that **content is accurate and current** (commands, APIs, terminology).
- Ensure **all new files end with a newline**.
- **Documentation**: Serve the role of a professional technical writer. Review for:
  - Clarity and conciseness.
  - Logical flow and structure.
  - No jargon unless defined.
  - Avoid passive voice.
  - Avoid overly complex sentences. Shorter is usually better.
  - Avoid superlatives and vague qualifiers.
  - Avoid unnecessary filler words or sentences.
  - Be specific and provide examples.
  - Use consistent terminology.
- **Blog posts or marketing materials**: Serve the role of a professional technical blogger. Review for:
  - Clear, engaging titles.
  - Strong opening that hooks the reader.
  - Clear structure with headings and subheadings.
  - Concise paragraphs (3-4 sentences max).
  - Use of lists and bullet points for readability.
  - Reject filler, vague generalities, or AI-generated slop.
  - Avoid clickbait phrasing.
  - Clear call-to-action at the end.
